# text-replacement-extension

Chrome extension designed to allow the user to replace text on a webpage with the string of their choice.

--- Using the Extension ---
Current state: Extension will ask you to run as each page loads.

--- Future Additions ---
Future plans are to have a toggle function so that the feature can be toggled on and off.

Also, there will be configurable inputs so that the user can choose to change items other than ðŸ…±.

--- How to Install ---
